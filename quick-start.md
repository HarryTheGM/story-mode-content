***Story Mode*** is a game for weaving awesome stories and exploring exciting new worlds.  

Adventurers explore the wild and dangerous parts of the many worlds in search of ancient treasure and powerful artifacts. Monsters haunt the shadows of long abandoned ruins and deadly threats hide around every corner.

***Story Mode*** is best played by 4-6 players who have some dice, a way of making notes and a longing for adventure.  
*Optional: Snacks, Drinks, Atmospheric Music.*  

One player is the **Game Master (GM)** who describes the environment, narrates the story and portrays non-player characters (NPCs).  

Each other player creates an **Adventurer**. These characters will form the **Party**.  
 
The **GM** chooses an adventure to guide the party through. Spend a few minutes reading the overview of the adventure before you begin.  

The GM describes the environment and situation the adventurers are in.  
The players ask questions from the GM and describe their adventurers' actions. The GM describes the outcome.  

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, make a **skill check**. Succeed by rolling above **10** on a **D20**.  

When things get tense, track actions and movement in turns. Players roll a skill check to determine turn order. The GM acts for monsters and any NPCs on their turn.  

When a character takes damage, deduct it from their **HP**. When their HP reaches 0, they are **Out of Action**.  

**Armour** may be used to negate damage a number of times equal to its Armour value.  

**Resting** recovers HP and restores other abilities.  

Expansions on these rules can be found within the **How to play** section.  

Once you’re ready, the adventure begins.
